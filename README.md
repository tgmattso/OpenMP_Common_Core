This repository holds the materials for our OpenMP Common Core
tutorial.   

The slides used for the tutorial are in the following pdf file.

          OMP_common_core.pdf

We also include a pdf file with a "reference guide" to the common
core of OpenMP

          OMP_commonCoreRefguide.pdf

Finally, we provide two directories with code for the exercises: 
one using C and the other Fortan.  We hope to add C++ soon.
